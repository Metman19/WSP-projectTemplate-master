		<h2>About</h2>
		Hi my name is Giovanni Galvis.<br /> I currently live in Miami, FL and enjoy learing from school online.<br/>

		<h2>Call To Action</h2>
		<p><strong>What I hope to practice/learn?</strong><br/>
		The first component is the video background CTA, because it more eye catching than a single image or slider. A call to action is important because it is a response you want users to complete. </p>
		<br/>
		<p><strong>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD.</strong><br/>
		This is one of the main features at site of the company where I currently work. It is very popular feature on all the premium wordpress themes that I have seen. It is important to capture the visitors (users) attention as soon as they land on our site.</p><br/>

        <p>How might I build this?
        		<ul>
        			<li>Create the component using HTML5 < video > tag</li>
